## 1. Install Dependencies

Before diving into the project, ensure that all required Python libraries are installed. This project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies.

### **Command to Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies. You can create and activate one using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix or MacOS
# venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```

After activating the virtual environment, run the `pip install` command to install the dependencies within this isolated environment.

## 2. Download the Dataset

The project requires a specific dataset for image stitching tasks. Download the dataset manually from the following GitHub repository:

### **Dataset Repository:**
[Image-Stitching-Dataset](https://github.com/visionxiang/Image-Stitching-Dataset)

### **Steps to Download:**

1. **Download a Dataset Folder:**

   Visit the [Image-Stitching-Dataset](https://github.com/visionxiang/Image-Stitching-Dataset) repository and manually download one of the dataset folders (e.g., `NISwGSP`, `DHW`, or any other available content).

2. **Unzip the Folder:**

   Extract the downloaded folder to access the dataset files.

3. **Place the Folder into the Dataset Directory:**

   Move the unzipped folder into the project's `datasets` directory. For example:

   ```
   AdvancedImageStitching/datasets/
   ```

4. **Verify the Dataset Files:**

   Ensure that all necessary images and data files are present in the folder.

## 3. Run the Main Image Stitching Script

The `main.py` script performs the core image stitching operations, including feature detection, matching, homography estimation, and image blending.

### **How to Run:**

1. **Ensure You Are in the Project's Root Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/AdvancedImageStitching
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### **What It Does:**

- **Feature Detection:** Identifies key features in the input images.
- **Feature Matching:** Matches corresponding features between images.
- **Homography Estimation:** Calculates the transformation matrix to align images.
- **Image Warping and Blending:** Warps images based on homography and blends them to create a seamless panorama.

**Ensure that you have navigated to the project's root directory before running the script.**

## 4. Run the Evaluation Script

After stitching the images, the `eval.py` script evaluates the quality of the stitched panoramas using predefined metrics.

### **How to Run:**

1. **Ensure You Are in the Project's Root Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/AdvancedImageStitching
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python eval.py
   ```

### **What It Does:**

- **Performance Metrics:** Calculates metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to assess stitching quality.
- **Visualization:** Generates visual comparisons between original and stitched images.
- **Reporting:** Outputs evaluation results for further analysis.

---

- **Virtual Environment Management:** Always activate your virtual environment before working on the project to maintain dependency consistency.

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix or MacOS
  # venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
  ```

- **Running Notebooks:** Use Jupyter Notebook to interact with and modify notebooks.

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

---

## Summary

By following this setup guide, you'll establish a solid foundation for working on the **Advanced Image Stitching** project. Install the necessary dependencies, download the required dataset, and execute the main and evaluation scripts to begin creating and assessing high-quality panoramic images.
