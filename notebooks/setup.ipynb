    "# Advanced Image Stitching Project - Setup Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Advanced Image Stitching** project! This notebook provides a comprehensive setup guide to help you get started with the project, including installing dependencies, downloading the necessary dataset, and running the main and evaluation scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Dependencies**\n",
    "2. **Download the Dataset**\n",
    "3. **Run the Main Image Stitching Script**\n",
    "4. **Run the Evaluation Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Install Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the project, ensure that all required Python libraries are installed. This project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Command to Install Dependencies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies. You can create and activate one using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'\n",
    "python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Activate the virtual environment\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After activating the virtual environment, run the `pip install` command to install the dependencies within this isolated environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Download the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The project requires a specific dataset for image stitching tasks. Download the dataset manually from the following GitHub repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Repository:**\n",
    "[Image-Stitching-Dataset](https://github.com/visionxiang/Image-Stitching-Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps to Download:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download a Dataset Folder:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Visit the [Image-Stitching-Dataset](https://github.com/visionxiang/Image-Stitching-Dataset) repository and manually download one of the dataset folders (e.g., `NISwGSP`, `DHW`, or any other available content).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unzip the Folder:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Extract the downloaded folder to access the dataset files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Place the Folder into the Dataset Directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Move the unzipped folder into the project's `datasets` directory. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   AdvancedImageStitching/datasets/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify the Dataset Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Ensure that all necessary images and data files are present in the folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Run the Main Image Stitching Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main.py` script performs the core image stitching operations, including feature detection, matching, homography estimation, and image blending.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Run:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensure You Are in the Project's Root Directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd /path/to/AdvancedImageStitching\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Script:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python main.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What It Does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Detection:** Identifies key features in the input images.\n",
    "- **Feature Matching:** Matches corresponding features between images.\n",
    "- **Homography Estimation:** Calculates the transformation matrix to align images.\n",
    "- **Image Warping and Blending:** Warps images based on homography and blends them to create a seamless panorama.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensure that you have navigated to the project's root directory before running the script.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Run the Evaluation Script\n",
    "\n",
    "After stitching the images, the `eval.py` script evaluates the quality of the stitched panoramas using predefined metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Run:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensure You Are in the Project's Root Directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd /path/to/AdvancedImageStitching\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Script:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python eval.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What It Does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Metrics:** Calculates metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to assess stitching quality.\n",
    "- **Visualization:** Generates visual comparisons between original and stitched images.\n",
    "- **Reporting:** Outputs evaluation results for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Control:** Ensure that your project is under version control using Git. Commit your changes regularly.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  git init\n",
    "  git add .\n",
    "  git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Virtual Environment Management:** Always activate your virtual environment before working on the project to maintain dependency consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Running Notebooks:** Use Jupyter Notebook to interact with and modify notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  jupyter notebook\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues during installation or execution, ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the dataset is properly downloaded and extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this setup guide, you'll establish a solid foundation for working on the **Advanced Image Stitching** project. Install the necessary dependencies, download the required dataset, and execute the main and evaluation scripts to begin creating and assessing high-quality panoramic images."
